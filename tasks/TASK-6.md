## Task  #6: Fast Fibonacci Sequence
### Metadata
| Spec | Value |

| Difficulty | Medium |
| Max Worth | 15 points |
| Language Bonus | Haskell (+1 pts), Julia (+1 pts) |

You will be given a number `n` and you must calculate the `n`<sup>th</sup> Fibonacci number.

> [!CAUTION]
> If your program times out **then your answer's *output* and *efficiency* will be marked as lacking.** That's the catch. (See rubric)

> [!NOTE]
**From Wikipedia:** 
>
>In mathematics, the **Fibonacci sequence** is a **sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones**. Numbers that are part of the Fibonacci sequence are known as Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted $F_{n}$â€Š. **The sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1**, although some authors start the sequence from 1 and 1 or sometimes (as did Fibonacci) from 1 and 2.
>
> **Starting from 0 and 1, the sequence begins:**
> $0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, \ldots$

> [!IMPORTANT]
>We will start from $0$ and $1$.

> [!TIP]
> **Bonus (+3 pts)** 
The program is recursive and still doesn't time out
